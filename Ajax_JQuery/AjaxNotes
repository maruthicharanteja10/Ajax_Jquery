What is Ajax?
*************
->AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
->Ajax is not a programming language.
->AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
->Ajax is used to send Asynchronous requests to the server.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Synchronous vs Asynchronous calls

Synchronous call
->Synchronous Request in Ajax means JavaScript will stop processing your program until a result has been obtained from the server.
->The complete web page will be reloaded when a synchronous request is made.

Asynchronous call
->In asynchronous request doesn’t block the client, meaning the browser remains responsive.
->When a user sends an asynchronous request to the server, there is no need to wait for the response. The user can perform other operations while the request is being processed.
The JavaScript engine of the browser is not blocked, allowing for a smoother user experience.
->For asynchronous requests, the complete page will not be reloaded, unlike synchronous requests.
-------------------------------
how responses are handled in asynchronous AJAX requests?
->Responses from the server in AJAX are handled using callbacks.
->A callback is a special function used in AJAX that allows the server to send data to the client when it is ready.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Jquery?
->jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library designed with the philosophy of "write less, do more."
->jQuery simplifies JavaScript programming, making it easier to manipulate elements, handle events, and perform animations.
->The main purpose of jQuery is to make JavaScript easier to use on websites.
->jQuery reduces the need for writing long JavaScript code by wrapping common tasks into simple methods that can be executed with a single line of code.

Why Jquery?
->It simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling.
->It provides easy AJAX integration.
->It has cross-browser compatibility.
->It is lightweight and fast compared to raw JavaScript.
There are many JavaScript frameworks, but jQuery is one of the most popular and extendable options.
Many big companies use jQuery, including:
->Google
->Microsoft
->IBM
->Netflix

Note: JQuery will run completely same on all browsers
----------------------------------------------
What are Events?
- All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.  
- An event represents the precise moment when something happens.  
  Examples: 
  - Moving a mouse over an element  
  - Selecting a radio button  
  - Clicking on an element  

- The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired the moment you press a key."

### Common DOM Events  

| **Mouse Events**  |Keyboard Events | Form Events |Document/Window Events |  
|------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|  
| click           | keypress         | submit      | load                 |  
| dblclick        | keydown          | change      | resize               |  
| mouseenter      | keyup            | focus       | scroll               |  
| mouseleave      |                  | blur        | unload               |  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Ajax with jQuery  
- AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.  
- In short; AJAX is about loading data in the background and displaying it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page.  
- jQuery provides several methods for AJAX functionality.  
- With the jQuery AJAX methods, you can request text, HTML, XML, or JSON** from a remote server using both HTTP GET and HTTP POST – And you can load the external data directly into the selected HTML elements of your web page!
------------------------------------------------------
### jQuery load() Method  

- The jQuery **load()** method is a simple, but powerful AJAX method.  
- The **load()** method loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element.  

#### Example  
```javascript
$("button").click(function(){  
    $("#div1").load("demo_test.txt", function(responseTxt, statusTxt, xhr){  
        if(statusTxt == "success")  
            alert("External content loaded successfully!");  
        if(statusTxt == "error")  
            alert("Error: " + xhr.status + ": " + xhr.statusText);  
    });  
});
```
we can use in table filtering
-------------------------------------------
### AJAX get() and post() Methods  
- The jQuery get() and post() methods are used to request data from the server with an **HTTP GET** or **POST** request.  
- GET - Requests data from a specified resource.  
- POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.  
---------------------------
### AJAX Request with jQuery - Code  

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(event) {   ①  
        $.ajax({   ②  
            type : "GET",  
            url : remote_url,   ③  
            success : function(result) {  
                //process the result   ④  
            },  
            error : function() {  
                //handle error   ⑤  
            }  
        })  
    })  
</script>
```
